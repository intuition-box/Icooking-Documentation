# Technologies Used

## PWA

The application is built as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**, which means it can be used directly from a web browser but also installed like a native app on smartphones, tablets, or computers.

- **Advantages of a PWA:**
  - Lightweight installation (no need to go through an app store).
  - Works offline thanks to caching and the service worker.
  - Smooth and responsive experience.

### How to install the application:

1. Open the application in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox Mobile, etc.).
2. Click on the “Install” icon (or “Add to Home Screen” on mobile).
3. The application installs like a native app with its own shortcut and can be launched offline.

The cooking assistant is powered by an AI agent system based on Eliza.
Eliza makes it possible to create conversational agents capable of:

- Adapting the dialogue based on context (e.g., if the user forgot an ingredient).
- Managing real-time constraints (allergies, timing, dietary preferences).
- Suggesting intelligent alternatives to ensure the recipe’s success.
